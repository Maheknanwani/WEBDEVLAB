            <u> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</u> And sorry I could not travel both <br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could <br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
            And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
            Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,<br>
            And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden <br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way <br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, <br>
            <u> I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. </u> <br>
